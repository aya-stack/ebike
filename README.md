**E-Bike Monitoring Application**
This application, developed with Qt, allows users to monitor key metrics of their e-bike in real-time. The app provides data such as:

*RPM (Revolutions per minute)
*Speed
*Location (GPS tracking)
*Battery charge level
*Distance traveled
*Temperature
*Current power usage
The app can be connected to the e-bike's onboard system via Bluetooth to display and analyze these parameters in a user-friendly interface.
